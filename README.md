# interview-questions
Collection of simple snippets created for past interview questions

I hate whiteboard tests or being questioned on obscure code and algorithms that are rarely used on day to day basis during interviews. When I interview people for roles, I like to ask questions which are pertinent to the role they are applying for.

This repo is a collection of simple questions that are common pitfalls for developers.

I have posted them here so that past candidates are able to view the questions which were presented to them in order to imporove their knowlege for next time around.
